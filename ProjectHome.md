Using machine learning methods to detect metamorphic viruses generated by certain viruses generators.

Use IdaPro to generate the assembly code and then perform opcode frequency count.

Calculate the closeness of a virus file and a normal file. (D square score)

Then, will attempt to use Hidden Markov Model to detect the viruses. Might consider another method to compare the performance and result.
